# Flipnic hex patterns

This repository contains hex patterns that can be used with ImHex and are specific to various file formats used by the Flipnic PlayStation 2 game.

This is a part of the Flipnic extraction project, where we try to understand as much of the game's file formats as possible.


* [binfile.hexpat](binfile.hexpat) - Virtual filesystem for .BIN blob files [VFS support]
* [folder.hexpat](folder.hexpat) - Subfolders in .BIN blob files [VFS support]
* [fpc.hexpat](fpc.hexpat) - Camera sequences
* [ipu.hexpat](ipu.hexpat) - While Flipnic uses .IPU files, which are found in many PS2 games, it has made a few modifications to header and footer, which can be seen with this pattern file
* [msg.hexpat](msg.hexpat) - JA.MSG file (strings used by the game)
* [pss.hexpat](pss.hexpat) - Custom .PSS container, which contains audio/video streams
* [savefile.hexpat](savefile.hexpat) - Save file format
* [sst.hexpat](sst.hexpat) - Stage definition files (.SST)
* [tim2.hexpat](tim2.hexpat) - Texture files
* [saveicon.hexpat](saveicon.hexpat) - Save file icon (FICON.ICO)
* [vsd.hexpat](vsd.hexpat) - Vibration strength data (.VSD)

Incomplete patterns:

* [mlb.hexpat](mlb.hexpat) - Layout for various in-game menus
* [hd.hexpat](hd.hexpat) - Soundbank (VAB) header file (pattern is displayed correctly for music soundbanks, but sound effect .hd visualization is incomplete)
* [lp4.hexpat](lp4.hexpat) - Game resource file (usually 3D models and 2D text animations)


## Importing these files

1. Open a desired file in ImHex hex editor.
2. Make sure you see "Pattern editor" on the right side. If not, check View > Pattern editor.
3. Right click on text area of pattern editor
4. Choose "Import Pattern File..."
5. Choose "Browse.."
6. Find matching .hexpat file
7. Click "Open"
8. Press the play button to evaluate the pattern
9. If done correctly, certain areas of the file should get highlighted
10. If a pattern file has VFS support, you can also see stuff on the "Virtual Filesystem" tab. You can right click on a file and select "Open Selection View" or double click to analyze hex data of the virtual file separately.
