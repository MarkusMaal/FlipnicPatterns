# Flipnic hex patterns

This repository contains hex patterns that can be used with ImHex and are specific to various file formats used by the Flipnic PlayStation 2 game.

This is a part of the Flipnic extraction project, where we try to understand as much of the game's file formats as possible.


* [binfile.hexpat](patterns/binfile.hexpat) - Virtual filesystem for .BIN blob files [VFS support]
* [folder.hexpat](patterns/folder.hexpat) - Subfolders in .BIN blob files [VFS support]
* [fpc.hexpat](patterns/fpc.hexpat) - Camera sequences (.FPC)
* [ipu.hexpat](patterns/ipu.hexpat) - While Flipnic uses .IPU files, which are found in many PS2 games, it has made a few modifications to header and footer, which can be seen with this pattern file
* [msg.hexpat](patterns/msg.hexpat) - JA.MSG file (strings used by the game)
* [pss.hexpat](patterns/pss.hexpat) - Custom .PSS container, which contains audio/video streams
* [savefile.hexpat](patterns/savefile.hexpat) - Save file format
* [sst.hexpat](patterns/sst.hexpat) - Stage definition files (.SST)
* [tim2.hexpat](patterns/tim2.hexpat) - Texture files (.TM2)
* [saveicon.hexpat](patterns/saveicon.hexpat) - Save file icon (FICON.ICO)
* [vsd.hexpat](patterns/vsd.hexpat) - Vibration strength data (.VSD)

Incomplete patterns:

* [col.hexpat](patterns/col.hexpat) - Collision maps (.COL)
* [fpd.hexpat](patterns/fpd.hexpat) - Object movement data (.FPD)
* [mlb.hexpat](patterns/mlb.hexpat) - Layout for various in-game menus (.MLB)
* [hd.hexpat](patterns/hd.hexpat) - Soundbank (VAB) header file (pattern is displayed correctly for music soundbanks, but sound effect .HD visualization is incomplete)
* [lay.hexpat](patterns/lay.hexpat) - The game uses these files to find where things are on the stage, as well as scaling and skew effects (.LAY)
* [lp4.hexpat](patterns/lp4.hexpat) - Game resource file (usually 3D models and 2D text animations)


## Importing these files

1. Clone this repository
2. Open ImHex
3. Go to Extras > Settings > Folders
4. Add a folder that points to this repository (IMPORTANT: choose the root directory, not patterns folder)
5. Close the Settings window
6. You can now apply a pattern if you go to File > Import > Pattern file

If you open a file with a known header, ImHex will automatically prompt you to apply a pattern:
